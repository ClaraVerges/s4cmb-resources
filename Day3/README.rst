How to submit your questions or requests during the bootcamp?
===============

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests!
Go to the s4cmb repo on github, and click on the corresponding buttons:

.. raw:: html

    <img src="https://github.com/JulienPeloton/s4cmb/blob/master/s4cmb/data/submit_an_issue_or_request.png" height="400px">

By doing so, requests, questions and discussions will be accessible to anyone, and more people can
review it and help solving the problems. All questions and answers are stored so that you can also
find later the solution to a problem you may encounter but has already an answer.

For requests, we appreciate the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow, as explained
`here <https://github.com/JulienPeloton/s4cmb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.
